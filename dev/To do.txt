Now:
    v - Replace string enums by Enum or Literal
    v - Settle the issue on how modules' extra parameters (e.g. some boolean fields of the class) are saved and loaded.
    v - For each constructor input argument, think carefully of its name and default value.
    v - For each field, decide whether to expose it as a property or hide it
    v - Check whether the .to() code is inherited properly, and whether .reset_parameters() should also be inherited, and
        whether its implementation is ok.

Later:
    - Read and improve all the generated HTML documentation:
      1. Add 'see also' where applicable, especially in the definitions of Enum values, or where these values are
         provided as input arguments.
      2. Add some missing references to equations in the paper, e.g. in different Enum options for the total mass encoding
         method and function
    - Make the "create dummy bins" command available standalone
    - Add that dummy creation command and a cleanup to the prepare_for_upload script
    - Create examples and tests

Later-later:
    - Convert the PyTorch sparce tensors to manual (inds,vals) pairs
    - Use full type hinting all over the code
    - Fix the memory waste thing

Fix pycharm's undos - make them less aggressive
