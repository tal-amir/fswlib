Now:
    - Replace string enums by Enum or Literal
    - Settle the issue on how modules' extra parameters (e.g. some boolean fields of the class) are saved and loaded.
    - For each constructor input argument, think carefully of its name and default value.
    - For each field, decide whether to expose it as a property or hide it
    - Check whether the .to() code is inherited properly, and whether .reset_parameters() should also be inherited, and
      whether its implementation is ok.

Later:
    - Make the "create dummy bins" command available standalone
    - Add that dummy creation command and a cleanup to the prepare_for_upload script
    - Create examples and tests

Later-later:
    - Convert the PyTorch sparce tensors to manual (inds,vals) pairs
    - Use full type hinting all over the code
    - Fix the memory waste thing

Fix pycharm's undos - make them less aggressive
